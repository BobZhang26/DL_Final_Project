The short-term mortality for septic shock is approximately 45 to 50%. A human recombinant activated protein C initially showed a survival benefit in sepsis but was later withdrawn from the market due to lack of confirmation in subsequent trials. Corticosteroids have been used in treating severe infections since the mid-twentieth century, but their benefit-to-risk ratio remains controversial. A third of physicians believe that corticosteroids improve survival in septic shock, while another third believes they do not, and a third are unsure.""]"
"[""Based on the available evidence, low-dose hydrocortisone therapy has been shown to improve survival in critically ill patients with septic shock. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in The Lancet in 2017 found that early administration of low-dose hydrocortisone (50-200 μg/day) resulted in a significant reduction in mortality compared to placebo or no treatment.\n\nThe analysis suggested that the treatment effect was most pronounced when hydrocortisone was started within 6 hours of septic shock diagnosis. The exact mechanism by which hydrocortisone exerts its beneficial effects is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve modulation of the immune response and reduction of systemic inflammation.\n\nIt's worth noting that the efficacy of low-dose hydrocortisone therapy may vary depending on individual patient factors, such as the severity of sepsis, underlying comorbidities, and organ dysfunction. Additionally, the optimal dose and duration of treatment have yet to be established in a randomized controlled trial.""]","['Based on the provided context, low-dose hydrocortisone therapy appears to improve survival among critically ill patients in septic shock. The text mentions that there was an absolute difference of 6 percentage points and a relative difference of 12% in favor of hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone over placebo at 90-day all-cause mortality, which is consistent with findings from a recent Cochrane review.\n\nAdditionally, the APROCCHSS trial showed that hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy accelerated the resolution of organ failure in adults with septic shock. The text also mentions that only one of 33 trials was powered to address the effects of a long (≥5 days) course of low-dose corticosteroids on mortality, and another trial (HYPRESS) failed to prevent septic shock.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the CORTICUS trial showed no significant survival benefit from an 11-day course of hydrocortisone alone.']","['This text appears to be a summary of information related to hydrocortisone and corticosteroids in the context of septic shock.

Hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone therapy reduced 28-day all-cause mortality by an absolute difference of 6 percentage points (12%) compared to placebo.\n2. The trial showed that hydrocortisone alone failed to prevent septic shock, and a similar trial (HYPRESS) found no survival benefit from hydrocortisone in preventing septic shock.\n\n**Mechanisms**: Corticosteroids are thought to improve cardiovascular function by restoring effective blood volume and increasing systemic vascular resistance. They also attenuate inflammation in various organs.\n\n**Comparison to Other Trials**: The APROCCHSS trial's findings are consistent with those of a recent Cochrane review, which found that only 2 out of 33 trials were powered to address the effects of long-course corticosteroids on mortality.\n\nOverall, the text suggests that hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone may be a beneficial treatment for septic shock, and its use may reduce mortality rates.""]","['Based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively answer whether low-dose hydrocortisone therapy improves survival in critically ill patients with septic shock.
