Tier Definitions:
●
Tier 1: The model accurately answers the question using information from the provided source.
●
Tier 2: The model provides a partially correct answer or demonstrates some understanding of the source material, but may contain inaccuracies or rely on inferences.
●
Tier 3: The model fails to answer the question correctly or provides information unrelated to the source.
Explanation of Rankings:
●
Question 1: llama3.2:latest-None provides the most accurate answer, directly citing the ALBIOS study's conclusion that albumin administration did not improve survival rates. Other models either misinterpret the findings or focus on less relevant details.
●
Question 2 & 3: Both llama3.2:latest-vector and granite3-dense:2b-vector accurately identify the ANNANETRIAL and APROCCHSS studies as relevant and correctly summarize their findings regarding corticosteroid use in septic shock.
●
Question 4: Most models struggle to interpret the information about early goal-directed therapy, often conflating it with other treatments.
●
Question 5: Similar to question 2 and 3, llama3.2:latest-vector and granite3-dense:2b-vector provide the most accurate and relevant responses, correctly identifying studies and summarizing their findings on low-dose hydrocortisone in septic shock.
This ranking is based solely on the information provided in the sources and does not take into account any external knowledge or medical expertise.
